# Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
In this study I develop a machine learning based click through rate prediction model.
This study uses a model that generates accurate results with low computational power consumption. 
By using four classification techniques, namely K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
The study was performed on the Click-Through Rate Prediction Competition Dataset.
